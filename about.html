          <h2>About Me...</h2>  
          <p>I’m a passionate and motivated beginner web developer currently building my foundation in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy turning creative ideas into responsive, user-friendly websites that work across all screen sizes.</p>
          <p>I’ve developed small projects like to-do lists, landing pages, and personal portfolios, and I’m constantly learning modern tools and frameworks like Git, Tailwind CSS, and React.</p>
          <h3>My key strengths include:</h3>
          <p>&#x2022; Writing clean, semantic HTML and modern CSS</p>
          <p>&#x2022; Building responsive designs using Flexbox and Grid</p>
          <p>&#x2022; Adding interactivity with JavaScript (DOM manipulation, events)</p>
          <p>&#x2022; Learning quickly and solving real-world coding problems</p>
          <p>&#x2022; Collaborating through Git and GitHub</p>
